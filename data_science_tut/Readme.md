Hello, this was my first encounter with data science - i learned what data science really mean, i get in touch with some data science tools, tools for visualization. 
I tried to use numpy, matplotlib and then we used pandas modules.
It definitely broadened my perspective and give me new expirience with new tools - i really appriciate numpy and pandas I think there is many interesting thing that could be done with those two modules...
