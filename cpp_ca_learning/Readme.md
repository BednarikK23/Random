Hello, this is my first encounter with C++ programming language.  Throughout this project, I developed a foundational understanding of its semantics and syntax. The only aspect I didn't cover here pertains to dynamic memory allocation and deallocation on the heap. But I searched for t in docmentation an I think I have good idea about how this works from C programming language, that I understand well (- projects in C in school_work folder, need acces in private - ask). With these projects I laid great foundation, now it will be easier to broaden my knowledge with C++ course on freeCodeCamp on Youtube.
