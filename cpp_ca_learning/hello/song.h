 * Constructors
 * Is there a way to give an object some data right when it gets created? Weâ€™re so glad you asked!
 * A constructor is a special kind of method that lets you decide how the objects of a class get created.
 * It has the same name as the class and no return type.
 * Constructors really shine when you want to instantiate an object with specific attributes.
