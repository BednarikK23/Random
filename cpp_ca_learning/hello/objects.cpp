/*
 * For larger projects, itâ€™s recommended to split up the class definition in a header and a .cpp file.
 * Doing so requires class methods to be defined outside of the class definition.
 * In this scenario, use the ClassName:: namespace to indicate that the function belongs to that class.

 * For example, if the banner() function was defined separately, it would look like this:

void School::banner() {
  std::cout << name << " is " << age << " years old.\n";
}

 Note: Even though a method can be defined outside its class, it must still be declared inside it.

 * ACCESS SPECIFIERS

 * But sometimes you need access to class members, and for that, there is public.

// 1) Attributes, also known as member variables, contain information about an object of the class.
