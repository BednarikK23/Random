This project is a small yet exciting endeavor where we've developed a prompt system connected to ChatGPT. In addition to this interactive chat functionality, we've incorporated some extra features for calculating stock prices and generating plots. Our project utilizes a range of powerful libraries including OpenAI, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib, yfinance, and other intriguing modules.
Features
Interactive Chat: Engage in natural and dynamic conversations with ChatGPT.
Stock Price Calculation: Utilize stock data to calculate prices, enabling quick and informed decisions.
Plot Generation: Generate informative plots and visualizations for stocks, enhancing data-driven insights.

This project, though small in scope, brought about a great deal of satisfaction. It provided an opportunity to explore and incorporate a variety of new tools and technologies. Notably, working with the OpenAI and Streamlit libraries was an enjoyable experience that introduced us to innovative possibilities.
