hello there, just wanted to code something in cpp, because i have no experience with this language,  
so i decided to try something from yt. At first it was really boring and didnt give much new knowledge, so 
i at east modified the code after we were done, so that it check inputs - at least a bit (so it wont crash every time you enter a letter instead of a number).

then i was curious how to pass function as argument and if it is possible to decompose the code into smaller parts - it was, haha.
At the end i add ltrim function because i thought it was not working properly.., it helped a little + i have ltrim in-place function now, so i can use it in the future.
