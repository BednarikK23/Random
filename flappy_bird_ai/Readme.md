This project is my first attempt at programming something using neural networks and artificial intelligence. I followed a YouTube tutorial series by Tech with Tim, and most of the code is derived from that source. You can find the tutorial series [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzMcBGfZo4-lwGZWXz5Qgta_YNX3_vLS2).

Throughout this project, I learned many new concepts related to AI, neural networks, and Pygame module. The experience of building this game was challenging, but also incredibly rewarding. It introduced me to the world of game development and inspired me to explore more creative projects.

This project might not be entirely original, but it served as a stepping stone for me to learn and grow as a programmer in the AI/NN domain.
